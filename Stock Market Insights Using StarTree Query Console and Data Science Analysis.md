Abstract
This project aims to leverage StarTree Query Console to analyze financial stock data, answering queries about dividends, earnings per share (EPS), stock movements, and sector-based ratings. By analyzing these financial metrics, this project provides insights into the performance and investment potential of stocks from 2020 to 2024. Python and R will be used for extended data science applications, helping us perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

2. Problem Statement
The objective is to extract, query, and analyze financial data of stocks over several years to provide investors and analysts with actionable insights. Specifically, the project focuses on identifying stocks with high and low dividend payouts, EPS trends, volume movements, and sector-based ratings.

3. Existing System
Currently, stock market data is analyzed using basic financial tools or manual calculations. This can be slow, error-prone, and lacks scalability for large datasets or multi-year analysis.

4. Proposed System
The proposed system uses StarTree Query Console and multi-stage engines to run complex SQL queries for high-volume stock data, along with Python and R for additional data processing and analytics. This enhances efficiency, accuracy, and provides powerful insights into stock market behavior.

5. Software Requirements
StarTree Query Console for data ingestion and query execution.
Python for data cleaning, processing, and visualization.
R for advanced statistical analysis and visualizations.
Database: SQL-based storage system or equivalent for initial data storage.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for Python, and dplyr, ggplot2 for R.
6. Development and Deployment Procedure
Step 1: Data Ingestion and Querying
Load the data into StarTree Console, then execute the following queries. Here are the specific queries needed:

Top 10 stocks that paid the highest dividend in 2020

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, dividend
FROM stock_data
WHERE year = 2020
ORDER BY dividend DESC
LIMIT 10;
Bottom 10 stocks that paid the lowest dividend in 2020

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, dividend
FROM stock_data
WHERE year = 2020
ORDER BY dividend ASC
LIMIT 10;
Top 10 stocks with the highest EPS between 2020-2024

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, MAX(eps) as highest_eps
FROM stock_data
WHERE year BETWEEN 2020 AND 2024
GROUP BY stock_symbol
ORDER BY highest_eps DESC
LIMIT 10;
Bottom 5 stocks with the lowest EPS between 2020-2024

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, MIN(eps) as lowest_eps
FROM stock_data
WHERE year BETWEEN 2020 AND 2024
GROUP BY stock_symbol
ORDER BY lowest_eps ASC
LIMIT 5;
Top 10 volume movers in 2023

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, volume
FROM stock_data
WHERE year = 2023
ORDER BY volume DESC
LIMIT 10;
Bottom 10 volume movers in 2023

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, volume
FROM stock_data
WHERE year = 2023
ORDER BY volume ASC
LIMIT 10;
Top 10 stocks with ratings above 9 in the technology sector in 2023

sql
Copy code
SELECT stock_symbol, rating
FROM stock_data
WHERE sector = 'Technology' AND year = 2023 AND rating > 9
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
Step 2: Document Query Stats
For each query, document:

Execution time
Rows scanned
Indexes used
Join conditions (if applicable)
Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization with Python and R
Here’s a sample code for handling this data in Python and R for visualization:

Python Example (for EPS Trend Analysis)

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the EPS data
eps_data = pd.read_csv('stock_eps.csv')
top_eps_stocks = eps_data.groupby('year')['eps'].max().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
top_eps_stocks.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Top 10 Stocks by EPS (2020-2024)')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('EPS')
plt.show()
R Example (for Volume Movers in 2023)

R
Copy code
library(ggplot2)

# Load data
stock_data <- read.csv("stock_volume_2023.csv")

# Filter top 10 volume movers
top_volume <- stock_data %>% arrange(desc(volume)) %>% head(10)

# Plot
ggplot(top_volume, aes(x = reorder(stock_symbol, volume), y = volume)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Volume Movers in 2023", x = "Stock Symbol", y = "Volume") +
  theme_minimal()
7. Applications
Investor Insights: Identifies top-performing and underperforming stocks for informed investment decisions.
Financial Analysis: Helps financial analysts gauge stock trends, earnings growth, and sector-wise performance.
Automated Financial Monitoring: Enables automated insights into stock market changes.
8. Future Scope
The project can be expanded to:

Integrate real-time data for live monitoring.
Incorporate machine learning to predict future trends in dividends and EPS.
Enhance filtering options for more customizable queries, allowing cross-sector and historical trend analysis.
9. Conclusion
By utilizing StarTree Query Console and data analysis through Python and R, this project effectively provides insights into stock performance metrics. This approach is efficient and scalable, offering a foundation for deeper financial data analysis.

To get started with using Appwrite for a Hacktoberfest project in PHP, here’s a basic outline along with resources for setting up a PHP backend with Appwrite and creating a demo video.

Step 1: Install Appwrite
If you haven’t already, install Appwrite by following the instructions here. Appwrite can be run locally with Docker, making it easy to set up for development.

Step 2: Set Up Appwrite PHP SDK
Appwrite provides a PHP SDK to interact with the Appwrite backend. Install the Appwrite PHP SDK using Composer in your project:

bash
Copy code
composer require appwrite/appwrite
Step 3: Sample PHP Code with Appwrite
Here’s an example of PHP code to manage users and documents in a database. This script demonstrates creating a user, adding a document, and fetching it from Appwrite.

PHP Script (appwrite_demo.php)
php
Copy code
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // Load Composer packages

use Appwrite\Client;
use Appwrite\Services\Database;
use Appwrite\Services\Users;

// Initialize Appwrite Client
$client = new Client();
$client
    ->setEndpoint('https://[YOUR_APPWRITE_SERVER_IP]/v1') // Replace with your Appwrite endpoint
    ->setProject('[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]') // Replace with your Project ID
    ->setKey('[YOUR_API_KEY]'); // Replace with your API Key

// Initialize Database Service
$database = new Database($client);
$users = new Users($client);

try {
    // Create a new user
    $user = $users->create(
        '[USER_ID]',           // Unique ID for the user
        'user@example.com',     // Email
        'password123'           // Password
    );
    echo "User Created: " . $user['name'] . "\n";

    // Create a new document in a collection
    $document = $database->createDocument(
        '[COLLECTION_ID]',      // Collection ID
        'unique()',             // Unique document ID
        [
            'name' => 'Sample Document',
            'description' => 'This is a sample document'
        ]
    );
    echo "Document Created: " . $document['$id'] . "\n";

    // Fetch document details
    $retrievedDocument = $database->getDocument('[COLLECTION_ID]', $document['$id']);
    echo "Fetched Document: " . json_encode($retrievedDocument) . "\n";

} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
Replace placeholders [YOUR_APPWRITE_SERVER_IP], [YOUR_PROJECT_ID], [YOUR_API_KEY], and [COLLECTION_ID] with your Appwrite project’s specific details.

Step 4: Run the PHP Script
Execute the script from your command line or through a PHP server:

bash
Copy code
php appwrite_demo.php
This should output confirmation of user and document creation along with the fetched document data.
